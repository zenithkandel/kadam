I am a student at Kathmandu Model Secondary School in Kathmandu, Nepal. I am passionate about coding and have been actively contributing to my GitHub profile (@zenithkandel). I am very interested in accessing the GitHub Student Developer Pack, as it would greatly support my learning and development journey.

However, I have encountered an issue during the verification process. The system requests an upload of my student ID card, but my laptop camera only allows me to scan it, resulting in a slightly blurry image. Additionally, my student ID displays the date in the Bikram Sambat (BS) calendar format, which may not be recognized by the system. Because of this, my application has been rejected multiple times.

I would deeply appreciate your assistance in verifying my student status. I am more than willing to provide any additional documents or information needed to confirm my eligibility.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Best regards,
