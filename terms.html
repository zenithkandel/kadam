                <h3>12A.1 User-to-User Disputes</h3>
                <p>
                    Disputes between students and employers (regarding task quality, payment, deadlines, etc.) should first be resolved through direct communication on the platform.
                </p>

                <h3>12A.2 KADAM Mediation</h3>
                <p>
                    If direct resolution fails, either party may request KADAM's mediation by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Submitting a dispute report through the platform</li>
                    <li>Providing evidence (screenshots, chat logs, files, agreements)</li>
                    <li>Allowing KADAM up to 7 business days to review and mediate</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>12A.3 KADAM's Decision Authority</h3>
                <p>
                    KADAM reserves the right to make final decisions on disputes, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whether work meets agreed specifications</li>
                    <li>Whether payment should be released, held, or refunded</li>
                    <li>Whether deadlines were reasonable or extensions justified</li>
                    <li>Appropriate penalties or consequences for violations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Our decisions are final and binding unless challenged through legal channels.
                </p>

                <h3>12A.4 Reporting System</h3>
                <p>
                    Users can report violations, fraudulent activity, or inappropriate conduct through the platform's reporting feature. All reports are investigated by our team, and appropriate action will be taken based on evidence and severity.
